/**
 * A SharpContext is an instance of a SHARP algorithm execution. SHARP
 * algorithm can be tuned according to a number of parameters and
 * SharpContext is the place where you set them. It is also responsible to
 * carry data to allow processors communication.
 * The parameters available for customization are the following:
 *  - Shape size ~ An integer representing height and width of the Test input
 *      image.
 *  - Min Theta ~ The lower bound of the angles interval to consider for
 *      shape orientation [degrees].
 *  - Max Theta ~ The upper bound of the angles interval to consider for
 *      shape orientation [degrees].
 *  - Theta step ~ The difference between two consecutive angles in our
 *      discrete space.
 *  - Length threshold ~ Minimum length starting from which we consider a
 *      tangent segment to the shape valid to contribute to STIRS signature.
 *  - Threads ~ Number of parallel threads to use.
 *
 * In addition to input parameters a number of other SHARP parameters are
 * evaluated, as they are a function of the input ones:
 *  - Min Distance ~ The minimum distance a line can have from the Hough
 *      Space origin. It equals <i>-shapeSize * (cos45째 + sin45째)</i>
 *  - Max Distance ~ The maximum distance a line can have from the Hough
 *      Space origin. It equals <i>shapeSize * (cos45째 + sin45째)</i>
 *  - Orientations ~ The number of orientations a line can have given the
 *      input interval <i>[Min Theta, Max Theta]</i> and the Theta step. It
 *      equals <i>abs(MaxTheta - MinTheta)/ThetaStep</i>.
 *
 * A SharpContext contains some structures to carry data required by SHARP:
 *  - Reference shapes ~ A list of ReferenceShapes of which we are testing
 *      the matching level with the input shape.
 *  - Scores Vault ~ A structure for exchanging partial matching scores
 *      among threads.
